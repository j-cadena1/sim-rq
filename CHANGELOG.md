## [0.9.3] - 2025-12-10

### Added

- **Storage proxy for reverse proxy deployments** - nginx now proxies `/storage/` to Garage S3, allowing file attachments to work behind Cloudflare Tunnel and other reverse proxies

### Fixed

- **Broken thumbnails behind reverse proxy** - Signed S3 URLs now use the public domain instead of internal Docker hostnames
- **File downloads failing** - S3 storage is now accessible through the `/storage/` path on the main domain
- **SSO configuration error toast** - Settings page no longer shows error when SSO is not configured via environment variables (returns empty config instead of 404)

### Changed

- **S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT default** - Now defaults to `http://localhost:8080/storage` for easier local testing

## [0.9.2] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- **WebSocket proxy** - Added explicit `/socket.io/` location block in nginx for reliable real-time notifications
- **Health endpoint routing** - Fixed nginx `/health` endpoint being caught by SPA routing (now uses exact match)
- **E2E test rate limiting** - Added missing `DISABLE_RATE_LIMITING` env var to dev docker-compose

### Changed

- **Redis container naming** - Renamed from `simflow-redis-*` to `sim-rq-redis-*` for consistency
- **Health check tests** - Now test backend `/health` and `/ready` endpoints through proxy (works in both dev and prod)
- **Notification preferences test** - Changed to validate structure instead of hardcoded defaults (fixes flaky test)

### Added

- **Vite health proxies** - Added `/health` and `/ready` proxy routes for dev server monitoring
- **nginx WebSocket timeouts** - 24-hour timeouts for long-lived WebSocket connections

### Documentation

- Updated CLAUDE.md with user lifecycle, session limits, and test count information
- Removed dead reference to non-existent REVERSE-PROXY.md
